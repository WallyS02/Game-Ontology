# Game Ontology

## The world of a selected computer game and the last adventure of a specific player

- [x] 8 concepts (they may include concepts equivalent to complex concepts)
- [x] 3 roles (necessarily a field and a sub-field for each!)
- [x] Abox part of reasoning process (individuals)
- [ ] Tbox part of reasoning process (DL Query, can something exist?, equivalent classes)
- [ ] Add concepts to new classes in field Equivalent To

Recommended interesting ways of reasoning include, for example:
using the concept of R some (R some C),
use of the R only C concept,
use of the R min n C concept,
use of the R max n C concept,
the use of exhaustive inheritance (e.g. classes are divided only into lectures, laboratories, seminars and projects).
